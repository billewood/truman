## An attempt to understand zebra finch communication in a controlled but natural environment. Program is ongoing, although no new data is being collected at this time (6/2024)

## There is code to:
## *) Run arduinos that control feeding and artificial predator (harmless) presentations. 
## *) Merge and align auditory recordings from FM wireless microphones recorded in Software Defined Radio (SDR)
## *) Track birds in 3D space using arrival times of auditory pings that are produced in an 8 speaker array
## *) Vocalizations are currently segmented using soundsep https://github.com/theunissenlab/soundsep2
## *) Cluster vocalizations into call categories
## *) Analyze behavior and vocalizations

## Decoding/understanding other species' vocalizations will require first understanding what those species are doing and then correlating those behaviors with their vocalizations.
## My technique is to track animals constantly, force particular behaviors with an automated environment that logs events, and then use large data to correlate the vocalizations. 
## The obvious species to do this with are zebra finches, as they are extremely social and extremely vocal.
